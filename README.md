## Why I do This

I believe __information mustn't be blocked based on political or other subjective views__.  

My maxim is _"Your freedom ends when it starts to confine the freedom of others"_.

Looking at how Russian government [distorts TV](https://therussianreader.wordpress.com/2015/11/22/russian-truckers-strike-dagestan/) and blocks [critics of Putin](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-russia-internet-idUSBREA2C21L20140313),
I decided to write an anti-censorship extension for Chromium before they strike me first.
