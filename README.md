# Russian Anti-Censorship on PAC-Scripts

Looking at how Russian government [distorts TV](https://therussianreader.wordpress.com/2015/11/22/russian-truckers-strike-dagestan/) and blocks [critics of Putin](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-russia-internet-idUSBREA2C21L20140313),
I decided to write an anti-censorship extension for Chromium before they strike me first.

This repo contains:
* Chrome Extension:
[WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/edit/npgcnondjocldhldegnakemclmfkngch)
| [Sources](https://github.com/ilyaigpetrov/anti-censorship-russia/tree/master/extensions/chromium/minimalistic-pac-setter)
* PAC-scripts performance analyses
* PAC-script generator based on https://github.com/zapret-info/z-i

## Why I do This

I believe __information mustn't be blocked based on political or other subjective views__.  

My maxim is _"Your freedom ends when it starts to confine the freedom of others"_.
